Task 8 has been completed successfully.

There is a CSS file named "styles".

There is an HTML file named "index". A screenshot has been successfully uploaded.

In addition, the working video has also been uploaded.

There are seven buttons, each with a custom background colour and box shadow.

With the power of CSS, I added a wiggle animation to headings, and also with the

enhancement of JavaScript to add sounds.

This makes them more attractive and unique than traditional heading styles.

The font addition is meant to make the site more attractive,

by providing a wider range of fonts that are easier on the eyes.

The Andika font and the Playfair Display style are added to buttons and headings.

Thank you !
