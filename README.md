# -amFOSS_tasks
I have successfully completed all 9 main tasks out of 11 . 
I understand that my submission may have been delayed.It was due to the work loads of my research and internship projects, as well as my end-of-semester exams. 
For that, I sincerely apologize.
However, I want to emphasize that from the first semester, I have been eagerly anticipating the opportunity to join amFOSS and learn more skills and contribute it to the team. The experiences I have gained through working for my research and internship have only furthered my passion and drive to be a part of this team .Once again, I apologize for the delay and I thank you for your understanding. I am looking forward to continuing to work with all of you and make a positive impact on the world through technology and open-source initiatives.                  I am sharing the github link below and I would be doing the optional tasks and updating on my progress.
I was really excited to do these tasks.
Thank you !
