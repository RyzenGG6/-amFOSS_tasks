These are the detailed terminal commands which I have used in each step : 
1.	The command for cloning the GitHub repository to our device is https://github.com/gauthamk02/TerminalHunt.git
2.	For creating a new directory called solution in the same repository. The Linux command used is mkdir solution
3.	For creating a file named part1.txt in the solution directory. The Linux command used is cat > part1.txt
4.	To copy a file with the cp command, use the following syntax: cp file1.txt folder/
5.	The fundamental syntax for renaming a file using the mv command is as follows: mv old filename new filename. This is for renaming part2.txt.
6.	Follow the procedures below to commit your work to the main branch:
1.	To begin, you must stage the modifications you made to your files. You may use the following command to stage all changes: add to git. Any modifications in your working directory will be staged as a result of this. Replace . with the file names or locations if you wish to stage certain files.
2.	Next, write a commit with a message describing the changes you made. Use the following command to generate a commit: commit -m "Commit message". "Commit message" should be replaced with a concise explanation of the changes you made. This message should be descriptive enough to give other developers an idea of what changes you made in this commit.
3.	Finally, to push your changes to the main branch on the remote repository, use the following command: git push origin main. Use git branch -a to see all the local and remote branches of the repository.
